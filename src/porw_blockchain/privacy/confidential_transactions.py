"""
Confidential transactions implementation for the PoRW blockchain.

This module provides functions for creating and verifying confidential transactions,
which hide the transaction amount while still allowing the network to verify that
the transaction is valid.

The implementation uses Pedersen commitments and bulletproofs for range proofs.
