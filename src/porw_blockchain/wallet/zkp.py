Zero-knowledge proof functionality for the PoRW blockchain wallet.

This module provides methods for creating and verifying zero-knowledge proofs
in the wallet, including:
- Creating confidential transactions with ZKP range proofs
- Verifying identity without revealing personal information
- Interacting with private smart contracts
- Submitting verifiable protein folding computations
