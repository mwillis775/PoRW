API Reference
=============

(Placeholder)

This section provides detailed documentation for the REST API exposed by the node.
The API allows interaction with the blockchain, such as submitting transactions,
querying blocks, and checking node status.

The API documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI and available interactively
when the server is running.
