Architecture Overview
=====================

(Placeholder)

This section describes the high-level architecture of the PoRW Blockchain Node.

Key Components
--------------

* **Core Engine:** Handles consensus (PoRW), block validation, transaction processing.
* **Networking (P2P):** Manages connections with peer nodes, block/transaction propagation.
* **RPC API:** Exposes node functionality via a RESTful interface (FastAPI).
* **Storage:** Persists blockchain data (blocks, transactions) using PostgreSQL/SQLAlchemy.
* **(Future) Real Work Interface:** Module interacting with external systems for PoRW validation.
